<ul>
  <li>Open your Node Js and npx create-expo-app --[ Name_Your_Project ] </li>
  <li>npx expo</li>

  <li>If you have finished entering the code above, then we enter the npx code</li>
  <li>react-native-init 'name_project'</li>
  <li>If you haven't installed android studio, then you must install android studio</li>
  <li>and you have android studio, you must enter the variable fromstorage D: or C:, here I show mine in C:/User/Local/AppData/Android/Sdk and enter it into your environment and make the title ANDROID_HOME, and also enter it in the system environment path section, enter platform tools from Android SDK like: C:/User/Local/AppData/Android/Sdk/Platform-tools</li>
  <li>then you first run the avd from your android studio, then when it is running and the avd appears, then you reopen the react-native project that you created earlier, then type in the terminal: npm run android, and it will automatically install the packages for running Android, and will also ask to install TypeScript. and when it's finished, your React-Native application will automatically run directly on the virtual device from Android Studio that you ran earlier. </li>
</ul>
